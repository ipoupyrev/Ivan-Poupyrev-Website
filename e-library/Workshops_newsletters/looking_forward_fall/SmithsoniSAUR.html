<b>Introduction</b><p>
<b></b>Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential to radically alter the way people
interact with computers and each other. Blending interaction, immersion and
imagination, the key features of virtual reality, developers are creating
synthetic worlds which do not exist in reality. This article outlines the
SmithsoniSAUR project which aims to develop one such world: a world which
disappeared million years ago - the world of the dinosaurs.<p>
<b>SmithsoniSAUR in brief</b><p>
<b></b>This SmithsoniSAUR project involves creating an immersive virtual world
of dinosaurs which users can enter and explore freely. It will provide people
with the unique experience of being in the dinosaurs habitat and get the
feeling of being part of this prehistoric world.<p>
This world will be completed by June 1996, when it will be opened for general
public at the IEEE Multimedia Systems and Applications Conference and
Exhibition in Hiroshima, Japan. This prestigious exhibition is organized in
cooperation with National Multimedia Program conducted by NTT (Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone Corporation) and will have exhibits from all the major Japanese
and international multimedia companies. The exhibition will be open to all
people interested in up-to-date multimedia technologies, not just registered
conference participants, so we expect a great interest from general public
toward.<p>
The idea of SmithsoniSAUR project originated with Prof. Ichikawa of Hiroshima
University, the  Chair of steering committee for the IEEE Conference. He and
other members of the organizing committee were very interested in presenting an
entertaining virtual reality experience which would attract the general public
to the conference exhibition. In the Fall of 1995 Professor Ichikawa suggested
idea of the project to the student chapter of the Virtual World Society (VWS)
at University of Washington in Seattle and promised endorsement from organizing
committee of the IEEE Conference. Student members of the VWS were very excited
to be involved in this project and accepted the offer to develop
SmithsoniSAUR.<p>
Thus the SmithsoniSAUR project began.<p>
<b>What is the Virtual World Society?</b><p>
<b></b>The Virtual World Society is a non-profit organization dedicated to the
spread of Virtual Reality technology and expertise. It was founded in 1994 by
Dr. Tom Furness who is director of the Human Interface Technology Lab at the
University of Washington. The current president is Joel Orr, a nationally known
US expert on computer technology and trends.<p>

<b></b>The very first student chapter of the VWS was started at the University
of Washington in September 1995. It aims to bring together students and
professionals, from different backgrounds, who share a common interest in
developing virtual reality applications. One of the current challenges with VR
is connecting the people with the technical knowledge with those who have ideas
for innovative applications. Increased synergy between engineers, programmers,
artists and other professions is important to develop compelling applications.
The student chapter of the Virtual Worlds Society is a place where technical
people can rub shoulders with non-technical and both benefit. As an example of
this, the SmithsoniSAUR project currently involves students from a wide range
of different backgrounds including Art, Architecture, Engineering, Computer
Science and Environmental Design. <p>
<b>SmithsoniSAUR - a sample scenario</b><p>
<b></b>There are several unique challenges in developing the SmithsoniSAUR
world. Designing a VR experience for an exhibition open the general public
imposes considerable limitations and requirements. The most severe one is time:
if each visitor spends 5-6 minutes in virtual world then only 80 visitors per
day can try the application. What would have happened if thousands of people
will attend an exhibition? For this reason SmithsoniSAUR is designed to be a
multi-user experience; up to four people can be in the virtual world at a time,
with more people viewing the world on a large projection screen. <p>
Another challenge is to provide a compelling experience in such a short time.
SmithsoniSAUR consists of 3 distinctive parts: an introduction, the interactive
dinosaur experience and closing. The introduction lasts for about thirty
seconds and will be a 3D video where users are flown through a virtual museum
and into the dinosaur exhibition hall. One of the dinosaur skeletons then leaps
from it's pedestal and crashes through a glass display window. Through this
hole the user can see into a prehistoric dinosaur world. At the same time the
walls of the exhibition hall fade and user is transported back in time.
SmithsoniSAUR now becomes interactive and the user can freely explore the land
of the dinosaurs.<p>
The interactive part of SmithsoniSAUR lasts for about four minutes and allows
users to experience the prehistoric world by means of interactive real-time 3D
computer graphics and 3D sound. Visitors will be armed with virtual cameras and
will be able to take photographs of dinosaurs in their natural habitat, be it
water, land or sky; witness battles between dinosaurs, or see the birth of baby
dinosaurs. The pictures they take will be saved as images that can be printed
out when they leave the world, giving them a permanent reminder of what they
saw. After four minutes a giant volcano will erupt cueing visitors that it's
time to escape back to the museum.<p>
The closing part of the SmithsoniSAUR will take about 30 seconds and will
automatically take users back from the dinosaurs world to the dinosaur
exhibition. Walls reappears at their old place, and the users fly through
museum back to where they started. After removing their head mounted display
they can pick up printouts of the pictures they shot in the virtual world.<p>
<b>What next?</b><p>
<b></b>The project is currently undergoing intensive application development,
using Division Ltd's VR authoring software. The whole world needs to be modeled
from scratch: land, sky and water; 3D models of the trees, dinosaurs, insects
and other creatures will be placed in the world. Life will then be breathed
into these objects through real-time animation. The last and the most important
step is to put user inside of the environment and develop interactions between
the user and the objects in the world. In April the first version of the world
should be completed and user evaluation will be started. A final version will
be shown in Seattle in May before being shipped to Japan several weeks later.
Members of the Virtual World Society will the go to Hiroshima  in June  and
work with Japanese students from Hiroshima University to set up the system and
run the demonstration during the 3 days of the exhibition.<p>

<b>Conclusions</b><p>
<b></b>Dinosaurs completely governed the earth for several million years and
then completely disappeared. They have attracted the imagination and interest
of people for centuries and now through SmithsoniSAUR people will be able to
experience their world. SmithsoniSAUR is a truly international  student project
and will hopefully be the first of many exciting projects undertaken by the
University of Washington student chapter of the Virtual World Society.<p>

<b>Acknowledgments</b><p>
<b></b>SmithsoniSAUR is a non-profit project and would not be possible without
support from industry and academia. The IEEE Computer Society has endorsed the
project, the Human Interface Technology Laboratory at the University of
Washington has provided computers and state of the art VR equipment for
development. Division Inc. has donated VR development software and Virtus Inc.
has given modeling packages. Eidolon Interactive provides us with WWW access.
Students of University of Tokyo are helping to digitize dinosaur models.<p>
