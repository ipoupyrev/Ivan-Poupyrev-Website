		<p>I am a career researcher in interactive technologies and interface design. My job is to come up with new ideas, concepts and research directions. Some of these ideas have become real products,  others inspired new research directions, while many others simply satisfy my curiosity.
		</p>
		<p>I am currently  directing an <a href="http://www.disneyresearch.com/interaction/">Interaction Group</a> at Disney Research, Pittsburgh and was at Sony before that. Please, see my <a href="bio/index.php">bio</a> for more details. </p>
		<p>This is my personal page that outlines some of my projects and what I have been up to. You can also check some of recent news on my <a href="http://ipoupyrev.wordpress.com/">blog</a>.
